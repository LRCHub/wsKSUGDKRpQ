[00:02.52] Hey, hey, hey, hey
[00:06.11] Ooh-ooh-hoo, woah
[00:14.61] 
[00:18.10] Won't you come see about me
[00:22.01] I'll be alone, dancing, you know it, baby
[00:27.04] Tell me your troubles and doubts
[00:30.68] Givin' me everything inside and out, and
[00:50.68] 
[00:35.35] Love's strange, surreal in the dark
[00:39.33] Think of the tender things that we were working on
[00:44.02] Slow change may pull us apart
[00:48.29] When the light gets into your heart, baby
[01:08.79] 
[00:52.10] Don't you forget about me
[00:58.60] Don't, don't, don't, don't
[01:01.53] Don't you forget about me
[01:14.03] 
[01:09.96] Will you stand above me
[01:13.96] Look my way, never love me
[01:18.40] Rain keeps fallin', rain keeps fallin'
[01:22.73] Down, down, down
[01:30.73] 
[01:26.98] Will you recognize me
[01:31.38] Call my name or walk on by?
[01:35.66] Rain keeps fallin', rain keeps fallin'
[01:40.23] Down, down, down, down
[01:51.23] 
[01:46.24] Hey, hey, hey, hey
[01:49.94] Ooh-ooh-hoo, woah
[01:58.44] 
[02:02.27] Don't you try and pretend
[02:05.85] It's my feeling, we'll win in the end
[02:09.50] I won't harm you or touch your defences
[02:14.48] Vanity, insecurity, ah
[02:25.48] 
[02:19.53] Don't you forget about me
[02:23.26] I'll be alone, dancing, you know it, baby
[02:28.00] Going to take us apart
[02:32.28] I'll put us back together at heart, baby
[02:52.28] 
[02:36.69] Don't you forget about me
[02:42.62] Don't, don't, don't, don't
[02:45.47] Don't you forget about me
[02:57.97] 
[02:51.70] As you walk on by
[02:56.16] Will you call my name?
[03:00.55] As you walk on by
[03:04.75] Will you call my name
[03:08.77] When you walk away?
[03:18.27] 
[03:17.47] Or will you walk away?
[03:28.47] 
[03:26.04] When you walk on by
[03:32.67] Come on, call my name
[03:37.17] Won't you call my name?
[03:48.67] 
[03:44.58] I sing, "La, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
[03:50.73] La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
[03:54.94] La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
[03:59.38] La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
[04:03.67] La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
[04:07.83] La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la"
[04:11.88] When you walk on by (walk on by)
[04:16.22] And you call my name
