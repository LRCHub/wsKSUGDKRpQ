[00:15.27] I don't like your little games
[00:19.99] Don't like your tilted stage
[00:23.61] The role you made me play of the fool
[00:28.10] No, I don't like you
[00:38.10] 
[00:30.22] I don't like your perfect crime
[00:35.09] How you laugh when you lie
[00:38.76] You said the gun was mine
[00:42.22] Isn't cool, no, I don't like you (oh!)
[01:01.22] 
[00:45.33] But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time
[00:49.25] Honey, I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time
[00:52.90] I got a list of names, and yours is in red, underlined
[00:57.11] I check it once, then I check it twice, oh!
[01:18.61] 
[01:00.34] Ooh, look what you made me do
[01:02.90] Look what you made me do
[01:04.55] Look what you just made me do
[01:06.32] Look what you just made me...
[01:07.97] Ooh, look what you made me do
[01:10.41] Look what you made me do
[01:12.13] Look what you just made me do
[01:13.82] Look what you just made me do
[01:28.32] 
[01:15.33] I (I) don't (don't) like your kingdom keys (keys)
[01:20.01] They (they) once belonged to me (me)
[01:23.74] You (you) asked me for a place to sleep
[01:27.18] Locked me out and threw a feast (what?)
[01:46.68] 
[01:30.50] The world moves on, another day another drama, drama
[01:34.28] But not for me, not for me, all I think about is karma
[01:38.08] And then the world moves on, but one thing's for sure
[01:41.85] Maybe I got mine, but you'll all get yours
[02:02.85] 
[01:45.54] But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time (nick of time)
[01:49.39] Honey, I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time (I do it all the time)
[01:53.04] I got a list of names, and yours is in red, underlined
[01:57.01] I check it once, then I check it twice, oh!
[02:18.51] 
[02:00.29] Ooh, look what you made me do
[02:02.75] Look what you made me do
[02:04.62] Look what you just made me do
[02:06.42] Look what you just made me...
[02:07.74] Ooh, look what you made me do
[02:10.28] Look what you made me do
[02:12.04] Look what you just made me do
[02:13.98] Look what you just made me do
[02:28.48] 
[02:15.34] I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
[02:19.24] I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams
[02:22.89] I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
[02:26.89] I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams
[02:30.25] I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
[02:34.34] I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams
[02:37.81] I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
[02:41.73] I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams
[03:05.23] 
[02:45.46] (Ooh, look what you made me do)
[02:47.85] (Look what you made me do)
[02:49.65] (Look what you just made me do) I'm sorry
[02:51.50] But the old Taylor can't come to the phone right now
[02:55.56] Why? Oh, 'cause she's dead (oh)
[03:11.06] 
[03:00.30] Ooh, look what you made me do
[03:02.89] Look what you made me do
[03:04.66] Look what you just made me do
[03:06.28] Look what you just made me...
[03:07.97] Ooh, look what you made me do
[03:10.32] Look what you made me do
[03:12.22] Look what you just made me do
[03:13.97] Look what you just made me do
[03:28.47] 
[03:15.26] Ooh, look what you made me do
[03:17.84] Look what you made me do
[03:19.66] Look what you just made me do
[03:21.31] Look what you just made me...
[03:22.76] Ooh, look what you made me do
[03:25.38] Look what you made me do
[03:27.26] Look what you just made me do
[03:28.95] Look what you just made me do
